# lesmis_Network_Analysis_using_Gephi
This project contains the weighted network analysis of coappearances of characters in Victor Hugo's novel "Les Miserables".  Nodes represent characters as indicated by the labels and edges connect any pair of characters that appear in the same chapter of the book.  The values on the edges are the number of such coappearances.  The data on coappearances were taken from D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993).
The file contained a network representing “who appears next to whom” in the 19th century novel Les Misérables by Victor Hugo. It displays a link between characters A and B means they appeared on the same page or paragraph in the novel.
